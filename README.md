# Political-Polarization-Project

###### The code in this repository collected the data and generated the results for my [Masters Thesis](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2235&context=masters_theses_2) A Relational Investigation of Political Polarization on Twitter. This study analyzed Twitter accounts that followed college political organizations during the lead up and aftermath of the 2020 Presidential Election. Using word embeddings, social network analysis, longitudinal models, and semi-structured interviews I demonstrated how the relationship between following political elites and emotional outrage depended on both the historical moment and the culture of the group that the individual belonged to.
